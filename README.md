This is a simple application that helps pet owners understand and track the financial side of owning pets. Owning a pet can greatly increase one’s quality of life, but we should be sure that taking on this responsibility is within the scope of the adopter’s budget.

This tool will help track costs of things like food, vet bills, toys, accessories, insurance, pet deposits etc. in such a way that it is easier to determine costs per week, month, or year and help predict months that are more expensive. For example, vaccines are yearly, a spike in vet bills should be anticipated at these designated months. Food is generally bi-monthly, toys are sporadic, and accessories like crates are often up-front costs.

All these things can help an owner make an informed decision whether or not they are ready to take on a companion.
